Summary
========
This is my final year project for university, it is a green security tool that will run on a raspberry pi. It uses a web interface to control the device and see statistics about what the device is currently doing and will alert if there is an issue.

Setup Process
========
1. Clone this repository and setup the device as the documentation says.
2. Please plug in the ethernet cable to the device and make sure it is in a secure and cool area (ie. not placed above a radiator)
3. Plug in the power cable and make sure a green light is shown on the front of the device (If not please unplug and contact support)
4. Boot time can take up to 5 minutes to setup the device
